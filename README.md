# Voltion Emulator

This repository contains the source code and supporting tools for a custom server and launcher originally developed for the Dofus 2.51 private server ecosystem.

This project includes:
- Modifications and enhancements to the base emulator code
- A custom launcher application for client updates, account management and authentication
- Integration with a user database and game assets

 **Note:** The original emulator core was not created by me, but I made very extensive improvements, commands, upgrades, fixes, desbug and extensions to the codebase to enable new features and stability for live usage.
